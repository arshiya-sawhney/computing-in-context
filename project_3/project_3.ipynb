    "\n",
    "The analysis helped us identify the top winner and loser U.S. states that have seent he highest and lowest income growth over the past decade respectively. Washington comes out on top, with Puerto Rico lagging last. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the sector-wise analysis did not reveal too much, we do indeed see that Professional, Scientific, Management, etc. is a leading sector for Washington. This likely includes high-paying white collar jobs driving income growth.\n",
    "However, the analysis does not allow us to strongly evidence or disprove the hypothesis on sectors because the data itself is not as granular. For instance, several occupations which may differ greatly in wages are clubbed together such as \"Management\" and \"Administrative\" or \"Waste Management\" services. Hence, we cannot conclusively provide evidence of differentiated sectors driving income growth in states that have seen high income growth. "
